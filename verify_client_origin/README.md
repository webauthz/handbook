Verify Client Origin
====================

# Introduction

This is an extension to the Webauthz specification.

In Webauthz, a client application may register with an authorization server
using any origin. Later, when the client requests access to a resource,
the `grant_redirect_uri` value must match the client's origin.

However, there are situations in which a client's origin needs to be verified
before there is an access request. This extension adds this capability to
Webauthz as an optional feature.

# Overview

A new endpoint is added to the discovery document to inform clients that
origin verification is supported by the authorization server.

The origin verification process has the following steps:

* [Start](#start)
* [Ready](#ready)
* [Verify](#verify)
* [Status](#status)

When origin verification is successfully completed, the authorization server
updates the client's registration to indicate it has been verified using
this method. This verification might be a precondition for the client to
access other features of the authorization server that are not in the scope
of this specification.

# Specification

## Discovery

The origin verification extension is declared in the discovery document
with `verify_client_origin_uri`. This informs clients about the location of
the origin verification API.

The discovery response should look like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "webauthz_register_uri": "https://resource.example.com/webauthz/register",
  "webauthz_request_uri": "https://resource.example.com/webauthz/request",
  "webauthz_exchange_uri": "https://resource.example.com/webauthz/exchange",
  "verify_client_origin_uri": "https://resource.example.com/webauthz/verify-client-origin"
}
```

In addition to the keys specified by Webauthz (`webauthz_register_uri`,
`webauthz_request_uri`, and `webauthz_exchange_uri`),
the response object SHALL include values for the following keys:

* `verify_client_origin_uri` indicates where a client can request origin verification (see [Start](#start))

The values are determined by the authorization server administrator.

## Start

A client application starts the origin verification process by sending a request
to the `verify_client_origin_uri` specified in the discovery response.

The request MUST include the `Authorization` header with the `<client_token>`.

To make the request with `curl`:

```
curl \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <client_token>' \
  -X POST \
  '<verify_client_origin_uri>'
```

The `verify_client_origin_uri` was or obtained via the [discovery](#discovery) step.
The `client_id` is implicit because of the use of the client-specific `client_token`
in the `Authorization` header.

If the authorization header is missing or the client token is invalid,
the authorization server SHALL deny the request with
`401 Unauthorized`.

The authorization server generates a new challenge comprised of a unique identifier
and a token.

A successful response should look like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "challenge_id": "<challenge_id>",
  "challenge_token": "<challenge_token>",
  "challenge_max_seconds": <challenge_max_seconds>,
  "ready_uri": "<ready_uri>",
  "status_uri": "<status_uri>"
}
```

The response object SHALL include the following keys:

* `challenge_id` is a value generated by the authorization server to identify this
  origin verification challenge; the value MUST NOT include the characters `/`, `?`, `&`, `=`, or `#`
* `challenge_token` is a value generated by the authorization server
* `challenge_max_seconds` indicates the time available to complete the challenge
* `ready_uri` indicates the endpoint for notifying the authorization server that the
  client application is ready to complete the challenge
* `status_uri` indicates the endpoint for checking the challenge status

The client application should then configure an HTTP resource to complete the
challenge. The resource MUST be located at `<client_origin>/.webauthz-http-challenge/<challenge_id>`.
If the `<client_origin>` value includes a trailing forward slash (it shouldn't),
the resulting double forward-slash in the resulting URL MUST be normalized to a single slash.

When accessed via HTTP GET, the resource MUST respond with the `200 OK` status and
`<challenge_token>` in the response body. The `Content-Type` header is optional, but
if it is present it MUST be `text/plain`.

A successful response should look like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain

<challenge_token>
```

After configuring the resource, the client application continues to the next step ([ready](#ready)).

## Ready

A client application continues the origin verification process by sending a request
to the `ready_uri` specified in the [start](#start) response.

The request MUST include the `Authorization` header with the `<client_token>`.

To make the request with `curl`:

```
curl \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <client_token>' \
  -X POST \
  '<ready_uri>'
```

The `ready_uri` was or obtained via the [start](#start) step.
The `client_id` is implicit because of the use of the client-specific `client_token`
in the `Authorization` header.

If the authorization header is missing or the client token is invalid,
or the specified challenge was not found, or the challenge was created by
a different client,
the authorization server SHALL deny the request with
`401 Unauthorized`.

The authorization server MAY queue the challenge
to check later or check the challenge synchronously and return
an updated challenge status.

Where the authorization server queues the challenge to check later, the
authorization server SHALL respond with `202 Accepted`. The client SHOULD
check the status later using the `status_uri`.

Where the authorization server checks the challenge synchronously, the
authorization server response MUST be the same as the response for the `status_uri`.

## Verify

Verification is an authorization server task.

The authorization
server sends an HTTP GET request to `<client_origin>/.webauthz-http-challenge/<challenge_id>`.
When the authorization server receives a response status `200 OK` and
response body `<challenge_token>`,
the authorization server updates the client registration to indicate the client
origin is verified via HTTP. If the response does not have the expected status or
body, the authorization server MUST NOT update the client registration.

## Status

A client application checks the status of its origin verification by sending
a request to the `status_uri` specified in the [start](#start) response.

The request MUST include the `Authorization` header with the `<client_token>`.

The status request is idempotent. The authorization server MUST NOT change the
status of a challenge in response to a status request. However, the authorization
server MAY impose rate limits and respond with `429 Too Many Requests` instead
of the status.

To make the request with `curl`:

```
curl \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <client_token>' \
  -X GET \
  '<status_uri>'
```

The `status_uri` was or obtained via the [start](#start) step.
The `client_id` is implicit because of the use of the client-specific `client_token`
in the `Authorization` header.

If the authorization header is missing or the client token is invalid,
or the specified challenge was not found, or the challenge was created by
a different client,
the authorization server SHALL deny the request with
`401 Unauthorized`.

The authorization server checks the status of the challenge for the client.

The authorization server then responds to the client with the status of the
origin verification.

A successful status check response should look like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "challenge_id": "<challenge_id>",
  "challenge_max_seconds": <challenge_max_seconds>,
  "status": "<status>"
}
```

The response object SHALL include the following keys:

* `challenge_id` is a value generated by the authorization server to identify this
  origin verification challenge
* `challenge_max_seconds` indicates the time available to complete the challenge
* `status` is one of the following values: 'pending', 'verified', or 'failed'

Meaning of the `status` values:

* 'pending' - the authorization server has scheduled the verification, or the verification
  is currently in progress, and the final status is not available yet; the client SHOULD
  retry the request later
* 'verified' - the authorization server has completed the verification and received
  the expected response; the client registration has been updated
* 'failed' - the authorization server could not complete the verification or received an
  unexpected response; the client SHOULD fix the problem and retry the request later

When the client application is done with the verification, the client SHOULD
remove the configured challenge so it is no longer available at the URL
`<client_origin>/.webauthz-http-challenge/<challenge_id>`.

# Configuration

To participate in the protocol, each of the parties must determine some
configuration settings that are shared with the other parties.

## Application

The application must have a way to configure a response to a URL like
`<client_origin>/.webauthz-http-challenge/<challenge_id>` so it can
respond to challenges.

This can be automated if the client application has access to do this,
or it can be interactive by providing the URL and the `challenge_token`
to the administrator so the administrator can create the resource.

## Authorization Server

To enable applications to request access to a resource, the authorization
server must define the following URIs:

* Verify Origin URI
* Ready URI
* Status URI

The Verify Origin URI is used by applications to start a client origin
verification request in the [start](#start) step.

The Ready URI and Status URI are provided to the client in the [start](#start)
response, so they can be different for each request (for example, they can
include the `challenge_id` in the path).

# Token usage

A token presented to the server must be sufficient to both
identify and authenticate the client.

## Challenge token

Generated by the authorization server in response to an application's
verify client origin request.

# Token format

The format of the token is unspecified because it is opaque
to clients.

# Discussion

## Challenge response

In contrast to the [ACME HTTP-01](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-8.3) challenge protocol, a Webauthz client
application DOES NOT need to compute the response to the challenge. It merely
needs to use the value received from the authorization server.

The challenge token value generated by the authorization server MUST be bound to
the client that requested the verification.

## Scope of verification

The [ACME HTTP-01](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-8.3) challenge protocol
is used to issue TLS certificates, which are valid for all port numbers in a domain. For this
reason, challenges must be answered on port 80 or 443 to ensure that a rogue program running on
a non-standard port cannot satisfy challenges and obtain a certificate for the domain.

However, Webauthz client origin challenges are NOT used to issue TLS certificates. Webauthz
client origin challenges are used to verify that a client can respond to
requests for a specific origin, which may be on a non-standard port, because a different port
could represent a different client application. For this reason, Webauthz
client origin verifications MUST occur on the same scheme, host, and port as the registered
client origin and are only valid for that client origin.

## Client application types

Origin verification is intended for web applications.
It is not intended for use by mobile or desktop applications, and would not
work for these client application types.
